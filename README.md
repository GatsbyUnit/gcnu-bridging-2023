Under construction.

To warm up you may want to work the (exercises on inference on the linear Gaussian model)[https://github.com/joacorapela/gcnuBridging2023/blob/master/lectures/probability/multivariateGaussian/inferenceInTheLinearGaussianModel/exercises/exercises.pdf].

In this [folder](https://github.com/joacorapela/gcnuBridging2023/tree/master/code/scripts/probability/multivariateGaussians/inferenceInTheLinearGaussianModel) you will find code to help you solve the previous exercises.

Here is my [solution](https://github.com/joacorapela/gcnuBridging2023/blob/master/lectures/probability/multivariateGaussian/inferenceInTheLinearGaussianModel/exercises/solution/rapela.pdf) to these exercises, and in this folder you will find code for these solutions.
