Under construction.

To warm up you may want to work the [exercises on inference on the linear Gaussian model](https://github.com/joacorapela/gcnuBridging2023/blob/master/lectures/probability/multivariateGaussian/inferenceInTheLinearGaussianModel/exercises/exercises.pdf).

In this [folder](https://github.com/joacorapela/gcnuBridging2023/tree/master/code/scripts/probability/multivariateGaussians/inferenceInTheLinearGaussianModel) you will find code to help you solve the previous exercises.

[Here](https://github.com/joacorapela/gcnuBridging2023/blob/master/lectures/probability/multivariateGaussian/inferenceInTheLinearGaussianModel/exercises/solution/rapela.pdf) is my written solution to these exercises, and in this [folder](https://github.com/joacorapela/gcnuBridging2023/tree/master/code/scripts/probability/multivariateGaussians/inferenceInTheLinearGaussianModel) you will find code for this solution.

To install the dependencies needed to run the above code, clone this repository and type ``pip install -e .`` from the root directory of the cloned repository.
